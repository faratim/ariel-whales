                Hello, my name is Ariel!<br><br>  
                I got interested in whales when I got my stuffed whale named Whaley.  
                I got him when I was born.
                And I've loved whales ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love whales because they do a lot of cool things and I think they are very insteresting.
            </p>
            <p>I would love to swim with a blue whale, that would be awesome! ...but also kind of dangerous.</p>
            <p>
                To me, whales are one of the coolest animals on earth!  
                And blue whales are the biggest animal that ever lived on earth.
            </p>
            <p>And that's how I got interested in whales!</p>
